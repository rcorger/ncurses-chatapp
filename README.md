# NCurses Chat App Project

Made in about a week. Several bugs which I hadn't bothered to fix (for instance, deleting characters from the input box sometimes bugs out).

If you wish to run the code on your machine, feel free to use `run.sh` files in the `./client-src` and `./server-src` directories.
